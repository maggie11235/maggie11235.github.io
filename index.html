    <tr><td><p> "Some Conceptual Problems in the IPCC Uncertainty Framework, How They Came About, and Where to Go from Here".
		 Manuscript available on request. <a style="float:right" class="revealer btn btn-default btn-xs"  title="Abstract">Abstract</a> </p>
   
   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> This paper has two related objectives. The first is to offer a thorough diagnosis of some
conceptual problems in the IPCC uncertainty framework. I believe that any successful attempt
to revise and improve the framework will have to start from a clear understanding of the current
conceptual problems, their implications for the IPCC authors’ treatment of uncertainties, and
the quality of the information provided in IPCC reports. Accordingly, the first objective of
this paper is to contribute to this first step. I begin by showing that there is no interpretation
of ‘confidence’ and ‘likelihood’ that is compatible with the IPCC uncertainty guide’s recommendations
- and thus with the resulting practice of the IPCC authors in their communication
of uncertainty. I argue that the lack of a conceptually valid interpretation of ‘likelihood’ and
‘confidence’ has worrying implications for both the practice of the IPCC authors in their treatment
of uncertainties and the quality of the information provided in IPCC reports. Finally,
I show that an understanding of the reasons behind the decision to include two uncertainty
scales in the IPCC uncertainty framework can give us some interesting insights into the nature
of this problem. Its second objective is to critically reflect on what an adequate IPCC uncertainty
framework could look like. I critically assess two strikingly different proposals for a new
IPCC uncertainty framework (Winsberg, 2018; Bradley et al., 2017) and I argue that in both
proposals the interpretation of ‘confidence’ is conceptually problematic. Finally, I offer my own
tentative proposal that meets what I take to be two basic desiderata for an adequate uncertainty
framework: conceptual clarity and decision relevancy.</p>

Explanatory Reasoning". Manuscript available on request. </i><a style="float:right" class="revealer btn btn-default btn-xs"  title="Abstract">Abstract</a> </p>
   
   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> In scientific inquiry, a “robust” result is often viewed as supporting a
hypothesis, but the Bayesian logic behind this requires careful examination.
Schupbach’s (2018) explanatory account of robustness analysis (RA) provides
valuable insights, particularly for empirically driven cases of RA. However, this
paper challenges the claim that this account equally applies to model-based
RAs. I argue that applying this account to model-based RAs is significantly
more complex than recognized by Schupbach and others and that it fails to
apply to a significantly broader range of model-based RAs than previously
assumed.</p>

   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> Debates on the role of values in science, particularly in relation to inductive risk, have
	remained largely orthogonal to disputes over the legitimate use of probability in inference. 
	This separation is surprising, as both concern the conditions under which scientific reasoning
	produces reliable and epistemically justified conclusions. In this paper, I argue that although
	discussions on values have been invaluable in highlighting the role of non-epistemic considerations
	in scientific practice, they have often overshadowed an equally pressing issue: the uncritical acceptance
	of probabilism as the default framework for representing uncertainty. This oversight has shaped philosophical
	debates on inference in ways that obscure important methodological concerns. A more critical engagement 
	with probabilistic reasoning is essential to upholding the epistemic rigor and integrity of scientific reasoning.</p>

		 <i> PhD Thesis </i> (2021). </i><a style="float:right" class="revealer btn btn-default btn-xs"  title="Abstract">Abstract</a> </p>
   
   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> The aim of this thesis is to improve our understanding of how to assess and communicate uncertainty
	   in areas of research deeply afflicted by it, the assessment and communication of which are made more fraught still by
	   the studies’ immediate policy implications. The IPCC is my case study throughout the thesis, which consists of three parts.
	   In Part 1, I offer a thorough diagnosis of conceptual problems faced by the IPCC uncertainty framework. 
	   The main problem I discuss is the persistent ambiguity surrounding the concepts of ‘confidence’ and ‘likelihood’; 
	   I argue that the lack of a conceptually valid interpretation of these concepts compatible with the IPCC uncertainty
	   guide’s recommendations has worrying implications for both the IPCC authors’ treatment of uncertainties
	   and the interpretability of the information provided in the AR5. Finally, I show that an understanding of
	   the reasons behind the IPCC’s decision to include two uncertainty scales can offer insights into the nature of this problem. 
	   In Part 2, I review what philosophers have said about model-based robustness analysis. 
	   I assess several arguments that have been offered for its epistemic import and relate this discussion
	   to the context of climate model ensembles. I also discuss various measures of independence in the 
	   climate literature, and assess the extent to which these measures can help evaluate the epistemic
	   import of model robustness. In Part 3, I explore the notion of the ‘weight of evidence’ typically associated with Keynes. 
	   I argue that the Bayesian (or anyone who believes the role of probability in inductive inference is to quantify 
	   the degree of belief to assign to a hypothesis given the evidence) is bound to struggle with this notion,
	   and draw some lessons from this fact. Finally, I critically assess some recent proposals for a new IPCC 
           uncertainty framework that significantly depart from the current one.</p>
